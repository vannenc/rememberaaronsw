I did not know Aaron Swartz before his campaign against SOPA. I have never met 
him in person and I did not know much about him either. Yet I am very saddened 
by what has happened.

Every technologist would agree that Aaron is the role model, whom most of us 
are striving to become one day. His works reflect dedication and talent at the 
highest degree. He has achieved so much in so little time and he has bestowed us with so many things; Things that we will never be able to return you back. 

We will always remember you.

Thank you, Aaron Swartz.
